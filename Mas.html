        <h1>About Coding</h1>
        <p>
            Coding, also known as programming, is the process of creating instructions that a computer can execute. 
            These instructions are written in a programming language such as JavaScript, Python, C++, or HTML/CSS. 
            Coding is essential for developing software, applications, websites, and much more. 
            It allows us to build solutions that can perform tasks automatically, solve complex problems, and enhance our digital experiences.
